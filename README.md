# Tenzies Dice Game

## Project Information
Created this simple game to play around with react and to learn how to use react as a javascript framework. This game is a dice game where the goal is to have all dice be the same number. To achieve this, a player must select the dice they would like to roll, then click "roll". The player is timed and the faster all their dice have the same number, the more points they get.
